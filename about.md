## About me

I belong to the species called programmers. As a part of my job, I use technology to improve or ease the lives of people. I have experience solving problems for Marketing, Sales, Human Resources and Public Sector. I am proficient on Cloud Technologies and Business Intelligence. I have built, managed and made productional Machine Learning pipelines as well as the technologies mentioned earlier. 

I am an avid food lover. I love trying out new cuisines. I truly believe that food holds the key to move your soul. I love Indian sweet preparations and Non-vegetarian food. If I am not at my computer, you will either find me reading or eating. You might even find me doing all of them together. 

This blog is where I plan to occasionally showcase my work, express my thoughts or opinions and share technical tutorials.
