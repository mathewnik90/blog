> Based on the reports from meteorological department, temperatures of less than<!--more--> -5 deg celsius are expected in northern states in India. The change is  attributed to recent change in the direction of the northeast winds. We have received predictions that these extreme weather conditions will prevail for 2-3 weeks. These weather conditions will hamper the entire transport system. There will be shortage of food and water. In the wake of these conditions, government has issued a notice that people should accumulate as much food as possible. I have already bought the food and stored for my family. Do not ignore the message and go ahead and do the same for the welfare of your family.
>
> Request you to forward this message to friends and family as soon as possible so that they do not starve and suffer during such dire circumstances.

Does the tone of this message sound familiar? When was the last time you got such a message on one of your WhatsApp groups? Yesterday, today or just now in some cases? Every day we are flooded with messages such as these on WhatsApp and other social media. Social media is the new medium for news and other important information to percolate into society. 

As per a [paper]( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf) published on January 2018, 1 in 4 Americans visited a fake news website during the 2016 election. This number is shocking, since such high numbers have the potential to change the course of history. Although the paper stated that the effects of fake news on people were shallow, it was not able to make a conclusive argument that fake news was not pivotal in the elections. 

The problem is much more severe in India where a [survey](https://www.livemint.com/Technology/O6DLmIibCCV5luEG9XuJWL/How-widespread-is-WhatsApps-usage-in-India.html) indicates that 25% of the participants use WhatsApp. The Wikipedia page on [Indian WhatsApp lynchingâ€™s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Whatsapp_lynchings) show more than 56 cases of lynching in 4 months (April, 2018 to July, 2018).

### Impact of technological advancements on fake news
The problem has further aggravated due to the advancements in technology. Any average person can buy a domain that looks like a popular news website and publish a fake article. It is a well known fact that images can be easily doctored. However, some  of you must have heard about [deep fakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMF2i3A9Lzw). This technology allows any person to swap a face in an existing video with another face. For an average person, it is impossible to differentiate that the video is fake. This has far reaching consequences with popular examples showing how political figures can be made to say things that they have never said in real life. Even without such advancement in technology [fake viral news](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/viral-whatsapp-hoaxes-are-indias-own-fake-news-crisis) were a common issue in India. One can imagine the impact that these advances can have on society.

### Effects of fake news on society
The fake news problem has disturbed the social trust fabric. The primary problem with fake news is that people become unsure of what to trust and what not to trust. This affects the information flow in the society and can have adverse effects especially on the health care and disaster management sectors. Criminal proceeding will be impacted since an image or a video that were once used for litigations will no longer be believed. Existing trials that are build on videos and images might be brought into question. Social and communal harmony can be significantly impacted. A random message from an unknown source might be sufficient to affect the reputation of a family or an entire community. 

### Steps to curb the problem
Fake news is such a huge problem since people forward messages without giving a second thought. People tend to believe and share unreliable content that they read on the Internet. It is time that we as a society realize that each of us is a cog in the system that is mongering fake news. 
Here are the steps you can take next time you get a sensational news:
1.	Avoid the urge to immediately forward, share or retweet the message. 
2.	Verify the news from multiple reliable news sources. Follow news from reliable news sources.
3.	Evaluate the news critically. If getting a $1 million inheritance is too good to be true, it probably is.
4.	Educate your acquaintances, family members, parents and children about this issue.

Technology companies are taking steps from their end as well. Some of the steps taken by famous technology companies are as below:
1.	WhatsApp 
    1.	Limited the number of messages forwarded in India to 5 chats
    2.	Add a symbol that shows a message is forwarded
    3.	[$50,000 award](https://www.whatsapp.com/research/awards/) to social scientists who can suggest possible solutions to the problem
2.	Facebook and Google News
    1.	Show related news articles

Although the menace of fake news will not go away any time soon, we can take simple steps from our end to ensure that another life is not lost to fake news.
